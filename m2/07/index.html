        Our mission: to help people learn to code for free. 
        We accomplish this by creating thousands of videos, 
        articles, and interactive coding lessons - all freely 
        available to the public. We also have thousands of 
        freeCodeCamp study groups around the world.
        Donations to freeCodeCamp go toward our education 
        initiatives and help pay for servers, services, and staff.
